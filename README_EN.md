## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever been stuck in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still a blank canvas; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. Although traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the requirement of being "fast," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute.
- 3️⃣ The final products look similar, suffering from serious homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low quality of assets and a lack of specific relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disconnected image-text layout and a poor sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still not "Vibe" enough.

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text required by the prompt and strictly follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero threshold and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and graphic-text element combinations to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Workplace Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation for various scenarios.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher output resolution (OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before page generation significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure the page description includes the specific text content to be rendered.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT (e.g., overlapping text, missing styles, etc.)**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to an API configuration issue. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation; it does not support image generation.

4. **Encountering 503 error or Retry Error during content generation**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is typically caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key not taking effect after setting it in .env?**
    - The Docker container must be restarted after editing the `.env` file during runtime to apply changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can restore the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings".
